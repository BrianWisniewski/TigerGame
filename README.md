## TigerGame
In TigerGame, there are two types of cards: purple and orange.
Each color has 10 cards ranked from 1 to 10, for a total of 20 cards in one 
deck (10 purple cards ranked 1-10 and 10 orange cards ranked 1-10). Each card has
a value. The value of purple cards is equal to their rank (e.g., purple:2 is worth 2 
points); the value of orange cards is equal to twice their rank 
(e.g., orange:2 is worth 4 points).
